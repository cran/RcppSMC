# RcppSMC: Rcpp for Sequential Monte Carlo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eddelbuettel/rcppsmc.png)](https://travis-ci.org/eddelbuettel/rcppsmc)

This package provides R with access to the 
[Sequential Monte Carlo Template Classes](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v30/i06/â€Ž) 
by Johansen (Journal of Statistical Software, 2009, v30, i6).

At present, two additional examples have been added, and the first 
example from the JSS paper has been extended. Further integration 
and extensions are planned.
